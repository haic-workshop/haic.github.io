**Talk Title:**  
<h1>The Perception‚ÄìAction Loop: a Framework for Anticipating Human Intentions</h1>


**Abstract:**  
Perception and action are deeply interwoven processes that shape how humans interact with their environment. Increasing evidence highlights that action planning can influence perceptual processing, suggesting a continuous bidirectional exchange between motor intentions and sensory input. Differences in perception can emerge even before movement begins, and actions such as reaching or grasping can subsequently alter the way objects are experienced. At the neural level, these dynamics are thought to rely on perception‚Äìaction interfaces supported by the parieto-frontal network. Understanding how action modulates perception not only provides insights into fundamental brain mechanisms but also offers promising avenues for designing human‚ÄìAI collaborative systems that can better anticipate and adapt to human intentions.

**Biographies of the Invited Speakers:**  

**Patrizia Fattori** is Full Professor of Physiology at University of Bologna. Her PhD in Neurophysiology (1994) focused on visual space encoding by neurons in parietal cortex. She leads the Laboratory of Neurophysiology of Visuomotor Systems in the Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences. Her studies focus on the neural processes linking vision to action, using a broad range of methods, from neural recording in non-human primates and neuroanatomy of the circuits involved in these processes, to human psychophysics, fMRI, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (https://site.unibo.it/fattori-lab/en). She is not only interested in deepening the knowledge about brain ability to quickly elaborate sensory stimuli to organize skillful and adaptable actions, but also she‚Äôd like to inform AI with this knowledge. She is the coordinator of an EU EIC project linking neuroscience to AI (https://site.unibo.it/maia-fetproact/en).



**Annalisa Bosco** is an Associate Professor at the Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, specializing in neurophysiology. She earned her Master‚Äôs degree in Pharmacy from the University of Bologna in 2006 and completed her PhD in Neurophysiology in 2010, focusing on reaching movements in 3D space. Since 2005, she has maintained a continuous trajectory of research, evolving from postdoctoral and junior research roles to her current position as Associate Professor. She is also Principal Investigator of several national and international research projects that bridge neurophysiology with artificial intelligence, fostering interdisciplinary approaches to human‚Äìmachine interaction. Her research is centered on the neural control of visuomotor responses, explored at two complementary levels. At the neural level, she has contributed to characterizing the functional properties of the cortical area V6A in the superior parietal lobule, investigating how visual information is employed in encoding reach and grasp movements and the coordinate systems underpinning their planning and execution. At the behavioral level, she has explored the interaction between perception and action across both oculomotor and skeletomotor systems, including mechanisms guiding reaching movements in three-dimensional space.
