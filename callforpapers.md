Submissions should be single blinded, i.e. authors names should be included in the submissions. Submissions must be made through the EasyChair conference system prior the specified deadline (all deadlines refer to GMT) by selecting HAIC as submission track. Discussion papers are extended abstracts that present your favourite recent application work (published elsewhere), position, or open problems with clear and concise formulations of current challenges.
