## Workshop Aim
Human-machine collaboration leverages the complementary strengths of humans (such as reasoning, creativity and social understanding) and AI (high computing power and big data processing capabilities) to improve problem-solving and performance of both humans and machines. The field of Human-AI Collaborative (HAIC) Systems is currently characterised by domain-specific solutions that address particular challenges. Successful applications combining humans and AI exist in healthcare, creative arts and finance, to name a few.
However, these works reveal the growing need for a systemic and generic approach to manage the complexity and heterogeneity of these systems. Effective collaboration between humans and AI requires systems that merge human and AI capabilities, adapt to each other's needs, and integrate qualitative and quantitative metrics. Furthermore, well-trained personnel are crucial to guaranteeing both the usability and real-world applicability of these systems. At the same time, AI tools must be designed to adapt unique peculiarities, knowledge, and emotional sphere of their users. The development of truly adaptive collaborative systems requires iterative refinement cycles in which the AI continuously learns from real-time interactions. This requires a redefinition of fundamental principles such as adaptability, security, trust and explainability, while also considering the psychological and ethical impact on users.

The aim of the first international workshop on Human-AI Collaborative Systems is twofold. On the one hand, we want to provide a space for researchers and practitioners to further stimulate the expansion and deepening of each of the research directions undertaken, stimulating dialogue and collaboration between the different communities. On the other, we want to promote a broader discussion that aims towards the definition of a general framework, capable of synthesizing common principles, thus offering a common foundation for future interdisciplinary and multimodal developments.
